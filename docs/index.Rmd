## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!!

## ABOUT THIS FILE:

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Abstract
We are concerned with the impact of major events on crime rates because we are currently in a global pandemic, and an economic recession is looming over us. During such times, safety and security become a major concern among other things. To address this concern, we intend to take a lesson from history by analyzing the impact that the Great Recession of 2008 had on criminal activity. Through this analysis we hope to learn more about the trends of criminal activities during such events and prepare for what to expect in the future.

### Keywords
Crime Rates, Economic Recession, Social Impact, Property Crimes, Violent Crimes

### Introduction
Our team's goal for this project is to determine the impact of the Great Recession on property and violent crime. In this project, we gather and analyze data before, during, and after the Great Recession to examine the change in the trends of criminal activity during an economic crisis. This information will help the general public and each state's safety department determine which aspects to focus on during an economic downturn, thereby improving people's safety during the next potential economic crisis.

### Design Situation
Our group is trying to investigate the trends of criminal activity under impacts of economic recessions. We decided to primarily focus on the great recession that happened from _December 2007_ to _June 2009_. The Great Recession was the most severe economic recession in the United States since the Great Depression of the 1930s. During this time, millions of people lost their jobs, banks went broke and investments shrank significantly.

We want to see how the economy can influence safety, which can be reflected through fluctuations of crime rate. In this way, we will be able to make predictions of events during future economic crises, and take necessary measures accordingly. We also aim to present how the morality and integrity of the members of a society can be impacted by major economic events, so that investors, bankers and governments can make more calculated decisions in the future. In addition to these professionals, some of our indirect stakeholders also include politicians who are trying to convey their political goals for the future with recession data. The media may also use this data to spread awareness of what to expect during an economic recession.

While such professionals may use this report to further their profit and agenda, our direct stakeholders- the general public, who could be potential victims can use this information to take necessary precautionary measures in cases of such events.

### Research questions
The main questions that our team will address:

1) The change in trends of violent crimes in each states before, during and after the Great Recession.

2) The change in trends of property crimes in each states before, during and after the Great Recession.

3) Which State had maximum criminal activity during 2008?

User research has prompted these inquiries. According to students from different states, 78% of them do not know how heavily their state was impacted, and what type of crime they should be most concerned about during an economic downturn. These questions are critical because they provide individuals and policy makers with knowledge about the situation during a downturn and enable them to better prepare for self-defense. In general, our team will respond to the questions by using R to compute the mean, median, maximum, minimum, skewness, and change of number of crimes, then making comparisons in each state from 2005 to 2011.


### The Dataset
This project uses the version 3.0.0 of the _State Crime CSV file_ as the primary source for information which was found on the official website of _CORGIS CSV Datasets_. This dataset was created by _Ryan Whitcomb, Joung Min Choi_ and _Bo Guan_ on _October 19, 2021_ (Whitcomb et al.). According to the CORGIS website, these information crime statistics are made available for the public review from the _Unified Crime Reporting Statistics_ with collaboration of the _United States Department of Justice_ and the _Federal Bureau of Investigation_.

The original dataset contains three thousand one hundred and sixteen observations (rows) and twenty one variables (columns). The variables include the names of the states, the year, population of the states in the corresponding year, and the rates and total number of two types of crimes- property crimes and violent crimes- committed in those states during that year. Types of property crimes included are property burglary, property larceny and property motor crimes, and types of violent crimes include violent assaults, violent murders, violent rape and violent robbery. These records are based on data collected from 1960 to 2019. While these statistics provide a focused view of the crime rates and totals of property related and violent crimes, it excludes a wide variety of other criminal activities. (Whitcomb et al.)

The exact source of funding for this database has not been mentioned. However, it is validated on the basis of its source. This data was created by using the reports of [_Crimes in the United States_](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/cius-summary) which was released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Moreover, it was created in collaboration with the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice. Evidently, this dataset is highly influenced by government agencies, and could potentially include biases of the “law makers”. Moreover the data also does not include the motivation of the crimes, which limits the scope of analysis and interpretations that can be made from it (FBI , 2018).

That being said, the lack of the aforementioned information could easily be used by corporations who deal with security, safety and well-being related products for increasing their sales, and hence their profit. For example, when there is an increase in the crime rate, companies who provide home security can use these statistics to create fear amongst people, and promote their products. Likewise, when there is a decrease in the crime rate in a particular area, a popular home security system may link the usage of their product to the decline to promote their company.

### Expected Implications
With the help of our visualization tool, technologists can easily compare increase or decrease in crime rates across states during the Great Recession. Our tool provides a convenient method for analysts to study the relationship between the change of crime rates and major economic events. Data analysts could also use this report to study the relationship between property and violent crime rates and other variables during an economic crisis.

For policy makers, our project serves as a great reference that provides a visual representation to monitor the changes in crime rates. They can compare certain trends in criminal activity across states, which can help them determine the necessary changes in national or state policies which can prevent rises in criminal activity and ensure the safety of people.

### Limitations
Although our project can analyze crimes’ data classified by states and crime types, the dataset does not show detailed information about the crimes in certain months. That means our project only focuses on analyzing crimes’ trend over the Great Recession years. As a result, it will be less effective in analyzing the effect of other minor events, which might just last for several months, on crime rates’ alterations.

In addition, our project assumes that the Great Recession is the main factor that affects the crime rates. We do have not considered other possible variables that could potentially affect these crime rates.
